# Landing-Page
For this project, I will build a complete web page based on a provided design from The Odin Project. The goal is to accurately replicate the design using HTML and CSS while applying best practices in web development.

A special thank you to the talented photographers whose stunning images from Unsplash enhanced this project: Bao Menglong, Nature Zen, Max Panam√°, and Erwan Hesry. Your work is truly appreciated!
